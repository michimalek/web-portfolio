I am Michael, was born in Hamburg, Germany and currently study in the Netherlands! During my educational career I was always connected to Technology, therefore I trained myself a skill set and major curiosity based around this topic. I would not call myself a specialist in a specific field of knowledge, but an all-rounder in a lot of different subjects. Besides that, my interests are Movie Theory, Game Design & Finances.
